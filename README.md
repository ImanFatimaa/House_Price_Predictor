# House Price Predictor
House Price Predictor Application

Overview:
This project implements a House Price Predictor application using Java Swing, designed to forecast house prices based on input parameters such as bedrooms and square footage. Leveraging a simple linear regression model, the application provides users with accurate price estimations.

Key Features:

Graphical User Interface (GUI): The application boasts an intuitive GUI with a modern design. It utilizes Java Swing components for interactive input fields and result displays, enhancing usability.

Linear Regression Model: Implemented from scratch, the linear regression model is trained using a pre-loaded dataset of house attributes. This model calculates house prices by combining coefficients derived from the training data.

Navigation and User Interaction: The GUI includes navigation buttons for seamless transitions between different screens:

Main Window: Allows users to input the number of bedrooms and square footage to predict house prices.
Prediction Window: Displays the predicted house price based on the user's input.
Home Window: Serves as the entry point, providing information about the application and guiding users to the main prediction functionality.
Customization and Design: The GUI design emphasizes clarity and user-friendliness. It features:

Unique color schemes and fonts to enhance visual appeal and readability.
Responsive layout management to ensure consistent display across different screen sizes.
Implementation Details:

Technologies: Developed entirely in Java using Swing for the frontend and Java standard libraries for data handling and logic.
Dataset: Includes a predefined dataset of house attributes (bedrooms, square footage) for training the regression model. This dataset ensures accurate predictions during runtime.
Future Enhancements:

Advanced Algorithms: Incorporating more sophisticated machine learning algorithms to improve prediction accuracy.
Data Integration: Supporting real-time data input from users or external databases to expand the application's usability.
Enhanced Visualization: Adding graphical elements such as charts or maps to visualize predicted prices and trends.
Conclusion:
This House Price Predictor project demonstrates proficiency in Java programming, GUI development with Java Swing, and fundamental concepts of machine learning through linear regression. It serves as a practical tool for both understanding predictive modeling and providing valuable insights into housing market trends.
